                    <p class="body-2">The SatsIndex domain, assets and intellectual property is available for sale at 25 BTC</p>
                    <p class="body-2">SatsIndex is a 'tongue in cheeck' medium to inform and educate people about Bitcoin becoming an everyday reality. 
                        This offer is admittedly 'tongue in cheeck' too, but should someone see the potential in this little venture, then a reasonable offer would be a welcome conversation.
