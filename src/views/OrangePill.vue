                <h3>Definitions: Orange Pilled</h3>
                <h4 class="mt-5">Urban Dictionary:</h4>
                <p>When you open somebody’s eyes to the realities that they are fucking idiots for not investing in bitcoin.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-5">How deep is the Rabbit Hole?</h4>
                <p>Once you take the Orange Pill, you start to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.</p>
                <p>This is a popular play on taking the red pill offered to Neo by Morpheus in the 1999 film 'The Matrix'. Taking the red pill opened his eyes to the difficult truths of reality wheras the blue pill would have left him in blissful ignorance.</p>
                <p>The Orange Pill is not a literal pill of course, it's a reference to the orange Bitcoin logo.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-5">Being Orange Pilled:</h4>
                <p class="body-1">Being Orange Pilled means you're likely to hold the belief in the narrative that Bitcoin is Gold 2.0 and will likely become the world reserve currency.</p>
                <p class="body-1">You may take the extremist position of a Bitcoin Maximalist and see all other cyrptocurrencies and fiat currencies as Shitcoins, Bitcoin as a leaderless, permissionless and trustless peer to peer payment network, the most decentralised, secure and truly decentralised form of sound money we have ever known.</p>
                <p class="body-1">You may take a more balanced view with a mindset that there are no certainties, only probabilities. You've taken the Orange Pill and believe that we're likely to see Saifedean's Bitcoin Standard, a separation of Money and State, while also appreciating a role to be played by other cryptocurrences in a wider ecosystem of digital assets.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-5">Nobody should have control of money:</h4>
                <p class="body-1">If you've been Orange Pilled, you'll see that the issuance and control of money should not be in the hands of one person, or one government, who can adjust monetary policy for political reasons, but instead completely free of centralised control with a predictable deterministic supply, that anyone can access from anywhere in the world.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-5">∞/21M:</h4>
                <p class="body-1">We have a choice - The infinite supply of fiat currencies, or the 21 Million capped supply of Bitcoin.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-5">Bitcoin will free humanity:</h4>
                <p class="body-1">Orange Pilled Bitcoiners aren't necessarily the greedy Lambo obsessed speculators they are often portrayed to be, many have thought deeply about the moral, social and political aspects of money and economics, and see Bitcoin as a tool to teach us the flaws of legacy money and a vehicle to unleash the spirit of creativity and innovation to take us to a freer, fairer and more prosperous world.</p>
                <h4 class="mt-5">The Call to Adventure:</h4>
                <p class="body-1">Being offered the Orange Pill is, in the Hero's Journey thesis of Joseph Campbell, your Call to Adventure. Here we are, sitting in our Ordinary World, working for a monthly salary and hoping to one day have some spare cash in the bank, when someone tells us to Buy Bitcoin - should you Wake Up and Follow the White Rabbit?</p>
                <p class="body-1">Just as Bilbo initially rejected Gandalf's adventure, and Luke Skywalker told Obi-Wan "I not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home", so too will most of us will find reasons not to take it, the Refusal of the Call, due to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) because we don't understand it, or we just don't believe it.</p>
                <p class="body-1">Once you Cross the Threshold, trade some not-yet-worthless fiat for Bitocin, and take the Orange Pill your eyes will be opened. There will be Tests of your resolve, Enemies will emerge who will tempt to sell, your Jelly Hands tremble, but Allies will convince you to HODL.</p>
                <p class="body-1">Eventually during the 4 year halving cycle, you'll face a terrible Ordeal, finding yourself in the Belly of the Beast as you see the Bitcoin value on CoinMarketCap plummet. But Rewards await those Hodlers with Diamond Hands, their strength of conviction vindicated as they've fought off the dragons to find their Pot of Gold 2.0.</p>
                <p class="body-1">The Return Home feels uneasy, friends and family misunderstand you, and you're never able to see the legacy world in quite the same way, standing proud in a crowd of blue-pilled naysayers, changed forever you've seen a world without rulers and controllers, a world without borders or boundaries, a world where anything is possible...</p>
                <p class="body-1">But as Obi-Wan says to Luke - "You must do what you feel is right, of course."</p>
