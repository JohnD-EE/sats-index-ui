            'Bitcoin is misunderstood, mischaracterised, and misconstrued. It takes time and effort to filter out the noise and make sense of it all. So we have to be patient with those who see it as a bizzare waste of computing power to solve nonsensical \'puzzles\' so that speculators and scammers can advantage themselves over the vulnerable.',
            'Without understanding its context, milennia of hubristic monetary policy and banking which subtly enslaves us all to what we commonly refer to as \'the system\' which may turn against us at any moment, our Bitcoin beffudlement will continue.'

            'We won\'t get there by shaming no-coiners or by propogating the black and white thinking of legacy media, we\'ll do better to step outside our world, see it from the perspective of the Noob, and patiently teach them about the Satoshi\'s beautiful gift to humanity.',

            'The proposition of SatsIndex is that our lives are mediated by money. Robert Anoton Wilson referred to money as Bio Survival Tokens, money emerges naturally as a concept in human society as a convenient way to facilitate exchange so we can each specialise in what we\'re good at and buy the things we can\'t produce ourselves. But money has become corrupted and debased, so that now we have to rely on government issued shitcoin which is backed by nothing. Bitcoin is the soundest form of money we\'ve ever known and so will organically grow to a point where our lives are mediated by Bitcoin',
