            'Bitcoin is misunderstood, mischaracterised, and misconstrued. It takes time and effort to filter out the noise and make sense of it all. So we have to be patient with those who see it as a bizzare waste of computing power to solve nonsensical \'puzzles\' so that speculators and scammers can advantage themselves over the vulnerable.',
            'Without understanding its context, milennia of hubristic monetary policy and banking which subtly enslaves us all to what we commonly refer to as \'the system\' which may turn against us at any moment, our Bitcoin beffudlement will continue.'
