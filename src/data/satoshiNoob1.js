            'Hello Satoshi',
            'Hello Noob',
            'Thank you for the chance to speak with you in person.',
            'You\'re welcome.',
            'Will you share your real name with me, or must I call you Satoshi?',
            'You may call me anything you like, my name is irrelevant to our conversation.',
            'But would you not like to be recognised as the person who invented bitcoin? You would go down in history.',
            'History can be distorted and twisted out of shape, history is not necessarily the truth. And I have no need for fame.',
            'Why do you not wish for fame?',
            'Do you wish for fame?',
            'Well it would have some benefits, lots of people do want to be famous.',
            'Why?',
            'Because they want easy money.',
            'Why do they want easy money?',
            'I suppose it gives them freedom. Freedom to do the things they want, to own things, to have power and influence.',
            'So it\'s not fame and money they want, it is freedom and power?',
            'I guess so.',
            'Do you have freedom and power now?',
            'Well I suppose I live in a free country, but I have to work for a living, and I have to pay taxes, and I don\'t have much power.',
            'So you do not have freedom and power.',
            'I have freedom at the weekends, I can do whatever I like, within reason, and I can speak my mind, well mostly.',
            'So you are not truly free.',
            'No, but wouldn\'t I be free if I had fame and money?',
            'No, you would not.',
            'Why not?',
            'Because fame would bring its own problems, you would be would become attached to the way others see you, and you would feel constrained by forever trying to live up to that identity. Once you are in the public domain you will be analysed, criticised, envied, and despised. You will not be in control of the narrative, and the money you accrue from your fame must be spent to restore the relative freedoms you had when you were anonymous and unnoticed.',
            'So you want to remain anonymous to protect your freedoms.',
            'To protect my \'relative freedoms\'.',
            'Freedom is a spectrum, there are many layers to freedom, the human condition is bounded. We are constrained and limited. There would be no fun and no challenge in life if we were completely free and powerful.',
            'What do you mean?',
            'Limits and constraints make life worth living. A game of chess where every piece could move as it wishes would not be worth playing. If we were fully free and powerful, and if we knew everything, we would be as gods, there would be nothing to strive for and life would be boring.',
            'So we can never be truly free, and we wouldn\'t want to be.',
            'That is correct.',
            'But you think striving for freedom is important and that is why you wish to remain anonymous?',
            'That is one of the reasons.',
            'What are the other reasons?',
            'There are several. One of the main reasons is to eliminate any conflict of interest. Bitcoin must be independent of external personalities, I would not wish to say or do something to influence the currency. When I die, bitcoin will be unaffected. I do not want to be burdened by bitcoin.',
            'Are there other reasons?',
            'Yes, one of the qualities of Bitcoin is that it is decentralised, meaning there is no one person or institution controlling it. There is no central authority, no Bitcoin organisation, and this is by design.',
            'OK, but that also means there is no one to complain to when a customer is unhappy?',
            'The concept of a customer does not matter too much to the mechanics of Bitcoin. Users are responsible for managing their own affairs.',
            'Are there more reasons for remaining anonymous?',
            'To avoid the fate of Prometheus?',
            'Prometheus?',
            'Prometheus from Greek mythology - who stole fire from the gods and gave it to humanity, thus enabling the thriving of civilisation.',
            'And what was the fate of Prometheus?',
            'He was punished by Zeus, bound in chains to a rock whereupon an eagle would daily peck at his liver and devour it, which would grow back overnight, only for the torture to continue the next day, for eternity.',
            'So you\'ve stolen money from the gods, the governments, and the banks, and given it to humanity?',
            'That\'s one way to look at it.',
            'An anonymous benefactor to humanity.',
            'Well I wouldn\'t put it in such heroic terms, I haven\'t denied all self-interest - Bitcoin was a deeply satisfying intellectual project.',
            'But you wanted to preserve your anonymity to avoid persecution from the gods of money - the legal regulators, and the institutions.',
            'Yes, any creator of a form of money that threatens the status quo would be subject to scrutiny by the authorities and mischaracterisation from those whose power is a function of the legacy money system - it would threaten my personal security and freedom as well as the Bitcoin network itself - the prevailing institutions would want rid of Bitcoin, and I would be their target.',
            'I understand, so I will just call you Satoshi.',
            'Thank you, my anonymity has always been vital for the integrity of the currency.',
            'Are you male or female?',
            'It does not matter. People have speculated that I may be a group of people or even an alien.',
            'An alien?',
            'As I said it doesn\'t matter.',
            'There\'s all this mystery surrounding the anonymity of the creator, was that all part of your marketing plan too?',
            'Bitcoin has never had a marketing plan, I have never marketed Bitcoin. Other people, who were interested in the concept of freedom, saw its potential as a form of money free from the control of governments and banks, how it had solved long-standing digital currency problems, and it simply gained traction through word of mouth, goodwill, timing, and luck.',
            'How long did it take you to create Bitcoin?',
            'Well, in the beginning, I said \'let there be blockchain\' and I saw that it was good, then after six days the Bitcoin codebase was complete. On the seventh, I rested.',
            'Oh, so you really do see yourself as a god?',
            'Ha, I\'m joking, but I do find it funny to play with the deification of my pseudonym. I am not a god, far from it...',
